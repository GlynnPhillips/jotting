# jotting

A simple, lightweight and fast platform for taking notes whist on the move.

Currently in inital stages of planning and prototyping with the plan to have an intial launch in time for [the transcontinental race](http://www.transcontinentalrace.com/).

## Status

This project is currently in early development and much of what has been built is throw away. Its currently been used for testing with the users.


## Lightweight, simple & fast

Cyclists of the transcontinental will be unsupported, camping and most importantly travelling across multiple countires. These are the main driving forces behind creating jotting as the cyclist will not want to waste time, battery and money simply trying to update their followers on their location, progress and experiences.
