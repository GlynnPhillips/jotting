				<h2>C.A.L.M</h2>	
				<p><a href="https://www.thecalmzone.net/">C.A.L.M</a> is a charity held closely to many very good friends hearts, they have been helping to support young men in need. Suicide is currently the single biggest killer of men aged 20-45 in the UK and in 2013 78% of all suicides were male. Long term C.A.L.M want to change culture so that any man can confidently get help when they need it.</p>

				<p>Most men who take their own lives aren’t in contact with any other agency, and don’t identify with much out there.  When asked, what they indicated they wanted was practical, anonymous, confidential help from professionals, which is why CALM was formed.</p>
